# L-Pack

Purpose:
Deterministic acquisition of local log and monitoring events.

Inputs:
- Structural log events
- Monitoring signals
- Local system indicators

Outputs:
- Normalized EventStream (non-operational)

Constraints:
- Offline-first
- No network access
- No dynamic execution
- No global state

Notes:
L-Pack provides symbolic, non-computational event structures for downstream correlation modules (M-Module). No operational logic, thresholds, or algorithms are included.
